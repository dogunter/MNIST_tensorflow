# MNIST TensorFlow

This is a basic tutorial for creating a neural network to recognize hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset for training and testing.

It was originally written for Tensorflow 1 but is being ported to work with the latest TensorFlow 2.0.

It is adapted from the excellent tutorial presented at the [Katakoda site](https://www.katacoda.com/basiafusinska/courses/tensorflow-getting-started/tensorflow-mnist-beginner)
